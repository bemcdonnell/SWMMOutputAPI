SWMMOutputAPI
=============
   
This package provides a Pythonic interface to a binary output file generated by USEPA Stormwater Management Model (SWMM5). This tool has proven to be useful in post-processing applications with both large and small output files.  The Python wrapper (SWMMOutputAPI.swmmbinreader) calls on a compiled object library which handles seeking though the binary output file.  Taking this approach increases the rate at which data can be read from a binary output file.

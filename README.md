# SWMMOutputAPI
SWMM Binary Output Reader - Python Wrapper for SWMM

This package provides a Pythonic interface to a binary output file generated by USEPA Stormwater Management Model (SWMM5). This tool has proven to be useful in post-processing applications with both large and small output files.  The Python wrapper (SWMMOutputAPI.swmmbinreader) calls on a compiled object library which handles seeking though the binary output file.  Taking this approach increases the rate at which data can be read from a binary output file. With a simpler collection of tools to access binary output, the user can spend more time on data analysis, visualization, and prototyping than plumbing.

## Installing

`pip install SWMMOutputAPI`


## Basic Tutorial

```python
from swmmbinreader import *

#Create and instance of swmmbinreader
OutputObject = swmmbinreader()

#Open Outputfile
OutputObject.OpenBinFile(r"C:\PROJECTCODE\SWMMOutputAPI\testing\outputfile.out")

#Get Link IDs
LinkIDs = OutputObject.get_IDs(SM_link)
print(LinkIDs)
>>> ['C3', 'C2', 'C1']

#Get Time Series
Times = OutputObject.get_TimeSeries()
print(Times)
>>> [datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 29, 14, 0), datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 29, 14, 1), ..., datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 29, 14, 9)]

#Get Data Series
Series = OutputObject.get_Series(SM_link, flow_rate_link, 'C2')
print(series)
>>> [3.908519983291626, 4.6215434074401855, 4.594745635986328, 4.595311641693115, ...,  4.595311641693115]

#Close Binary File
OutputObject.CloseBinFile()

```
